# Where to Contribute
---

One may contribute in below areas for now (more extension points will be added):

1. Plugins to provide default job templates for typical project layouts. Currently OneDev supports node.js, maven and gradle project
2. Various report plugins. Currently OneDev only publishes html reports and renders them as is. Plugins to publish and render other reports such as Mocha, JUnit, and Test Coverage are very welcomed. Some example of beautiful reports: https://demo.pmease.com/dashboard
3. Some art work such as logo/icon will also be very welcome

# Where One Can Contribute
---

One may contribute in below areas for now. More extension points will be added later:

1. Plugin to provide default job template for typical project layout. Currently OneDev supports node.js, maven and gradle project
2. Various report plugins. Currently OneDev only publishes html reports and renders them as is. Plugins to publish and render other reports such as Mocha, JUnit, and Test Coverage are very welcomed. Some example of beautiful reports: https://demo.pmease.com/dashboard
3. Some art work such as logo/icon will also be very welcome
